# Utility (Energy) Dashboard Project

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive utility (energy) dashboard that provides insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics critical to the energy industry. This dashboard aims to empower stakeholders with actionable data-driven insights for better decision-making and performance optimization.

## Stakeholders

- **Utility Executives**: Need high-level overviews of the company's energy production, costs, and efficiency.
- **Operations Teams**: Require insights into system performance, maintenance costs, and outage management.
- **Environmental Teams**: Seek information on carbon footprint and sustainability efforts.
- **Customer Service Teams**: Need data on customer feedback and satisfaction levels.

## Business Problem

The energy industry faces various challenges, including optimizing energy production, reducing carbon emissions, and ensuring reliable service. Key challenges addressed by this dashboard include:

- **Energy Production**: Monitoring and optimizing energy production across various sources.
- **Carbon Footprint**: Tracking and reducing carbon emissions to meet environmental regulations and sustainability goals.
- **System Efficiency**: Ensuring optimal system efficiency to minimize costs and maximize performance.
- **Maintenance Costs**: Managing maintenance activities efficiently to reduce downtime and operational expenses.

## Results

This project resulted in a comprehensive dashboard that provides the following insights:

1. **Total Energy Production**: Displays the total energy production over a specified period, enabling executives to gauge operational performance.
2. **Average Carbon Footprint**: Calculates the average carbon footprint, aiding environmental teams in sustainability efforts.
3. **Average System Efficiency**: Measures the average system efficiency, helping operations teams optimize energy utilization.
4. **Total Maintenance Costs**: Tracks the total maintenance costs, enabling cost-effective maintenance planning.
5. **Production by Source**: Visualizes energy production by different sources, providing insights into the contribution of each source.
6. **Seasonal Variations**: Analyzes seasonal variations in energy production, helping executives identify trends and plan accordingly.
7. **System Downtime**: Identifies downtime incidents and their causes, aiding operations teams in outage management.
8. **Customer Feedback**: Monitors customer feedback to gauge satisfaction levels and identify areas for improvement.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data generation and preprocessing.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive and informative dashboards.

## How to Use

1. **Data Generation**: Run the provided Python script to generate realistic utility data.
2. **Data Analysis**: Calculate KPIs and metrics using the generated data.
3. **Visualization**: Load the data into Power BI and create visualizations as described in the project.

## Future Work

- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Integrate real-time data feeds for up-to-date insights.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Implement machine learning models for predictive maintenance and energy forecasting.
- **Enhanced Interactivity**: Incorporate interactive features for drill-down analysis and dynamic filtering.
