Sure, I can help you with that. Below is the updated Python code to generate the necessary data for your hospitality dashboard, including more dates in the check-in and check-out columns for the last two years.

```python
import pandas as pd
from faker import Faker
import random
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Initialize Faker
fake = Faker()

# Generate fake data
data = []
start_date = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=2*365)
end_date = datetime.now()

for _ in range(2000):
    booking_id = fake.uuid4()
    room_type = fake.random_element(elements=('Single', 'Double', 'Suite', 'Deluxe', 'Family'))
    daily_rate = round(random.uniform(50, 500), 2)
    length_of_stay = random.randint(1, 14)  # stay length from 1 to 14 days
    total_revenue = daily_rate * length_of_stay
    customer_satisfaction = random.randint(1, 5)
    online_reviews = random.randint(0, 100)
    check_in_date = fake.date_between(start_date=start_date, end_date=end_date)
    check_out_date = check_in_date + timedelta(days=length_of_stay)
    booking_source = fake.random_element(elements=('Direct', 'OTA', 'Travel Agent', 'Corporate'))
    customer_nationality = fake.country()

    data.append([booking_id, room_type, daily_rate, length_of_stay, total_revenue, customer_satisfaction,
                 online_reviews, check_in_date, check_out_date, booking_source, customer_nationality])

# Create DataFrame
columns = ['Booking ID', 'Room Type', 'Daily Rate', 'Length of Stay (days)', 'Total Revenue',
           'Customer Satisfaction', 'Online Reviews', 'Check-in Date', 'Check-out Date',
           'Booking Source', 'Customer Nationality']
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=columns)

# Calculate additional metrics
df['Average Daily Rate (ADR)'] = df['Total Revenue'] / df['Length of Stay (days)']
df['RevPAR'] = df['Total Revenue'] / df.shape[0]  # Revenue per Available Room, assuming 2000 rooms available

# Export data to CSV
df.to_csv('hospitality_fake_data.csv', index=False)

# Output
print("Data exported to 'hospitality_fake_data.csv'")
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Data Generation**:
    - **Booking ID**: Unique identifier for each booking.
    - **Room Type**: Randomly selected from a list of room types.
    - **Daily Rate**: Randomly generated daily rate for the room.
    - **Length of Stay**: Random length of stay between 1 and 14 days.
    - **Total Revenue**: Calculated as the product of daily rate and length of stay.
    - **Customer Satisfaction**: Random rating between 1 and 5.
    - **Online Reviews**: Random number of online reviews.
    - **Check-in Date**: Random date within the last two years.
    - **Check-out Date**: Calculated based on the check-in date and length of stay.
    - **Booking Source**: Randomly selected from a list of booking sources.
    - **Customer Nationality**: Random country.

2. **DataFrame Creation**:
    - A DataFrame is created using the generated data and appropriate column names.

3. **Additional Metrics**:
    - **Average Daily Rate (ADR)**: Calculated as total revenue divided by length of stay.
    - **RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room)**: Total revenue divided by the number of rooms available (assumed to be 2000 in this case).

4. **CSV Export**:
    - The DataFrame is exported to a CSV file named `hospitality_fake_data.csv`.

### DAX Measures and Calculated Columns for Power BI

1. **Average Daily Rate (ADR)**
    ```dax
    ADR = AVERAGE('HospitalityData'[Daily Rate])
    ```

2. **RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room)**
    ```dax
    RevPAR = SUM('HospitalityData'[Total Revenue]) / COUNTROWS('HospitalityData')
    ```

3. **Customer Satisfaction**
    ```dax
    Customer Satisfaction = AVERAGE('HospitalityData'[Customer Satisfaction])
    ```

4. **Online Reviews**
    ```dax
    Online Reviews = SUM('HospitalityData'[Online Reviews])
    ```

### Charts

1. **Booking Sources**
   - Use a pie chart.
   - **Legend**: `Booking Source`
   - **Values**: `COUNT('HospitalityData'[Booking ID])`

2. **Room Type Popularity**
   - Use a bar chart.
   - **Axis**: `Room Type`
   - **Values**: `COUNT('HospitalityData'[Booking ID])`

3. **Seasonal Occupancy**
   - Use a line chart.
   - **Axis**: `Check-in Date`
   - **Values**: `COUNT('HospitalityData'[Booking ID])`
   - **Aggregation**: Monthly or Quarterly

4. **Customer Nationalities**
   - Use a bar chart.
   - **Axis**: `Customer Nationality`
   - **Values**: `COUNT('HospitalityData'[Booking ID])`

# Hospitality Dashboard Project

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an interactive hospitality dashboard using Python and Power BI to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics that are essential for managing hotel operations and making data-driven decisions. The dashboard provides insights into average daily rate (ADR), revenue per available room (RevPAR), customer satisfaction, and online reviews. It also includes visualizations for booking sources, room type popularity, seasonal occupancy, and customer nationalities.

## Stakeholders
- **Hotel Managers**: To monitor hotel performance and optimize room rates and occupancy.
- **Revenue Managers**: To analyze revenue metrics and improve revenue management strategies.
- **Marketing Teams**: To understand booking sources and target marketing efforts effectively.
- **Customer Service Teams**: To assess customer satisfaction and address feedback.

## Business Problem
In the hospitality industry, having real-time insights and detailed analysis of key metrics is crucial for effective hotel management and competitive advantage. Hotels often face challenges such as:
- **Optimizing Room Rates**: Setting the right room rates to maximize revenue while maintaining high occupancy.
- **Revenue Management**: Tracking and improving revenue per available room.
- **Customer Feedback**: Understanding and responding to customer reviews and satisfaction ratings.
- **Booking Trends**: Analyzing booking sources and seasonal trends to optimize marketing strategies.

This project addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive and interactive dashboard that consolidates all relevant hospitality data and visualizes it in an easily understandable format.

## Results
The dashboard successfully showcases the following:
- **Average Daily Rate (ADR)**: Calculation and visualization of the average daily rate across different room types and time periods.
- **RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room)**: Analysis of revenue per available room to evaluate the hotel's financial performance.
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Aggregation of customer satisfaction ratings to identify areas for improvement and enhance the guest experience.
- **Online Reviews**: Summarization of online reviews to monitor the hotel's online reputation.
- **Booking Sources**: Breakdown of bookings by source, helping to understand which channels are most effective.
- **Room Type Popularity**: Visualization of the popularity of different room types, aiding in inventory management.
- **Seasonal Occupancy**: Analysis of seasonal occupancy trends to inform pricing and marketing strategies.
- **Customer Nationalities**: Demographic analysis of guests to tailor services and marketing efforts.

## Project Features
- **Data Generation**: Utilized Python and Faker library to generate synthetic hospitality data mimicking real-world scenarios.
- **Data Processing**: Performed data cleaning and transformation using pandas to prepare the data for analysis.
- **DAX Calculations**: Implemented various DAX measures and calculated columns in Power BI for KPI computation and visualization.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Developed an interactive dashboard in Power BI that allows users to filter and drill down into specific metrics and visualizations.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data generation, cleaning, and transformation.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Faker**: For generating synthetic data.
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For calculating metrics and measures in Power BI.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the provided Python script to generate the synthetic dataset.
3. Load the dataset into Power BI.
4. Create the necessary measures and calculated columns using the provided DAX formulas.
